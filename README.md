## Bijay Kumar's Portfolio

I am a final year undergraduate at [VSSUT, Burla](https://vssut.ac.in) with a dream of giving back to the society with my learned skills. Currently experimenting with web development to know how much I have actually learned. I’m a quick and an ardent learner, always eager to grasp new technology stacks and their implementation. 

This is my personal portfolio website hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kumarbijay/kumarbijay.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
